    <h1>About this app</h1>
    
    <p>Covid data tracker is an app that shows covid cases from around the world. This app is fetching data from external endpoint, which at the time i wrote this paragraph still free working properly.
      I have no control over the API, so in the future if the API provider limit or close the service, then this app might not work anymore.
